# Vortex sheet simulation program for flapping-wing schooling (MATLAB)

## First touch
- Download the code. Open MATLAB and go to the program directory. Run `startup.m` (add necessary directories to the program path).
- Run `Aschool(1)`. You will see a log of things in MATLAB. Stop the program anytime by `CTRL+c`, and resume by running `Aschool(0)`.
- Find your simulation data files at `../data_twowing_schooling/amp0.2skin0.04sch1/`.
